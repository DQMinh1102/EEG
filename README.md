# EEG
*Real time device

H-M DEVICE is a blink detection system based on EEG, consisting of 2 channels  with 5 poles, wireless data transmission. 
In addition to blink detection, the system can also record and stored data
Methods: Fristly, based on the theory of brain electrical signals to to design amplifiers, filters, Analog-Digital converters, digital filter and electrodes. 
Second, practice designing and manufacturing electrodes and signal recive circuit systems, wireless signal reception solution (Bluetooth). 
Finally, learn Python programming, design digital filters, and finish the product.
Result: Successfully fabricated a fully functional product system that detects, stores and reviews the records.

*GUI

User can view signal in real time. Beside, they can store and review the records.
